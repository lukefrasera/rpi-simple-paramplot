0. Overview
===========

Surfaces in three-dimensional space can be described by a function which maps
values from a two-dimensional plane (u,v-coordinates) into 3D space (x,y,z).

Playing around with these functions can be fun and you can get some very pretty
surfaces with relatively concise formulas.

I wrote this program as a tool to play around with these, but also as an
exercise in OpenGL ES and parsing of mathematical expressions.

Also, I find it extraordinarily awesome that the Raspberry Pi can do this.


1. Compilation
==============

The program depends on GL, GLM and SDL, so make sure you have those installed
on your system before proceeding.

If you have everything, executing the following should compile the program:
    $ make


2. Usage
========

Take a look at the output of
    $ ./rpi-simple-paramplot -h
which shows you the available command-line options and how to use them.

When the program is running, you can use the following keys and buttons:
    Drag Left Mouse Button:           Rotate view.
    Drag Left+Right Mouse Button:     Roll view.
    Draw Middle Mouse Button Up/Down: Move view forward/backward.
    Escape: Quit program.
    F1:     Print keybindings.
    F2:     Toggle vertical synchronization.
    F3:     Toggle backface culling (can be used to
            enhance performance, but only with closed surfaces).


Have fun math-ing on your Raspberry Pi!
